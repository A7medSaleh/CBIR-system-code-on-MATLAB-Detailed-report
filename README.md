In this code I build a content based image retrieval system by extracting both primitive features and semantic features of input image and compare those to saved database reatures with very fast response time to search for most similar images with input image. Also with the code files you will find a detailed report (.docx file so you can edit it) with all codes details and scientific idea used in building it also with its refrences mentioned at the end.

The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program and it runs on MATLAB platform.

This software can be used in various fields like research in field of image retrieval and image processing also in field of machine learning and data mining
